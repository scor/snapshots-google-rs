This repository is a collection of HTML documents for testing Google Rich
Snippets with a focus on Drupal HTML markup.

Each directory includes snapshots of certain types which are recognized by the
[Google Rich Snippet testing tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets).
These snapshots are organized by date, and can be used for testing purposes to
ensure that Google keep supporting existing markup.

Each snapshot includes:

* The original HTML document (person.html)
* An HTML snapshot of Google Rich Snippets Testing Tool results (person.grstt.html)
* A screenshot of the Google Rich Snippets Testing Tool results (person.grstt.png)
